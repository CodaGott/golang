# Arithmetic Operators in GOLANG

The five 5 basic operators for calculation are:

    + Plus sign for addition.
    * Asterisk for multiplication.
    / Division.
    - Subtraction.
    % Mod for percentage.

When using golang operators, the values in the left and right side of the arithmetic operator needs to be of the same Data-Type.

When one of the values changes say you change an integer to a float, then you have to cast the int value to float at the calculation point.

Golang like every other programming language follows the "B O D M A S" flow.
