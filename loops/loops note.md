# Loops in GOLANG

Golang has multiple ways in which one can write for loops.

for loop is used to excute a block of code multiple times.

for loop Syntax in GO:
    
    1. for condition {
        action
    }
    The above loop syntax works the same as while loop in other languages and takes needed action while the condition is true.

    2. for variable; condition; increment;{
        action
    }

    The above loop syntax is used to define a variable in the same line as the condition.

    >>>> Golang uses the break and continue keyword; the break keyword is used to skip the program immediately it get's to it and the continue skips and comes back to complete the task <<<<
