# Functions in Golang

Functions are ways of writing reuseable codes that can be used in multiple places. To create a function, we start with the keyword "func" followed by the name we want our functions to have, parenthesis, and curl-braces. EXAMPLE below:
    syntax: func print(){} this is how you define a functions without parameters.

To define a function with parameters means to add a variable inside the parenthesis that will take a value when the function is called. To add a parameter to a function, after creating the functions as specified above, inside the parenthesis, add the name of the variable followed by it's data type.
Example below:

syntax: func print(name_of_the_parameter data-type){}
