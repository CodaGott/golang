# Condition & Boolean Expressions in Golang

    GOLANG has the standard comparism operators that most programming language has.

    > "the greater than sign."
    < "the less than sign."
    == "is equal to sign."
    <= "less than or equal to."
    >= "greater than or equal to."
    != "not equal to."

    When using any of these operators the answer will return either true or false based on the comparison that happened.

    Just like the arithmetic operators the values on the left and on the right must be of the same data-type or we'll get an error.
